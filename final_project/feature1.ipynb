      "<p>My requirement is as follows: I have an .stl file of a design and need to develop the CAD files for its mold. I will then need to 3D print these molds. I would require to add a hole to pour in liquid (resin based) raw material which hardens with time. </p>\n",
      "\n",
      "Comments:\n",
      "\t- What kind of mold you are looking for? for plastic extrusion or resine molding?\n",
      "\t- Adding a hole is trivial assuming you own a drill :-)\n",

The lid push-fits onto the box. <a href=\"https://3dprinting.stackexchange.com/q/6576/13100\">What kinds of gaps/tolerances should I use when designing pieces that fit together?</a> has advice for designing the clearance between the lid and the box. Assume I've already settled that question and I have a good clearance so my lid slides on and off freely.</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>Now I'd like to add a lip-and-groove feature to my design to hold it shut, with a lip on the lid that clips into a groove in the box when the lid is fully closed - like a cantilever fit, but easy to open, and directly on the mating walls.</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>How deep should I make the lip and how tall? Does it depend on what plastic I'm printing in? Does it depend on the wall thickness and the geometric rigidity of the part?</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "Comments:\n",
      "\t- it depends on all that and more. for the non engineer, testing a few variations and refining the prototypes are likely faster to give good results than theoretical plotting that overcomes dozens of unknown variables; temp, rigidity, printing humidity, material blend (eg plasticizers et al), size, tension, required precision, expected service life, sheer force on lip, and on and on and on. In general, you want it fairly difficult to snap, and you want the interface corners to be pre-rounded, so that wearing doesn't affect performance as drastically.\n",
      "\t- besides material, the actual design and print orientation also plays a huge factor.\n",
      "\t- I designed and printer a box with a sliding covered battery area once in Tinkercad and just removed shapes from each other to create the positive and negatice spaces. Therefore there was zero tolerance. Once I printed it I just filed and sanded the edges and they started sliding nicely together.\n",
