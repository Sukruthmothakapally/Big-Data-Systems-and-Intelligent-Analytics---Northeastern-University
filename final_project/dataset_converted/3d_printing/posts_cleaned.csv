9,2,2016-01-12T18:58:04.410,18,,"<p>Almost all 3D printers have issues that could cause health problems.</p>

<p>FDM/FFF printers heat plastic to a temperature that may cause it to off-gas, and these byproducts may not be healthy.</p>

<p>SLA printers often use epoxies that may off-gas, or may be somewhat toxic prior to being cured.</p>

<p>Powder based printers can also off-gas, in addition to the powder itself presenting a possible hazard.</p>

<p>Many hobbyist and small companies dance around the problem, and suggest that the machines always be used in well ventillated areas.  Professional machines often have filters and ventillation systems built in.</p>

<p>Rather than trying to find a ""perfectly safe"" 3D printer, spend some time deciding what you want to use one for, find printers suitable for your use, and expect that you'll need to provide reasonable ventilation for almost any printer.  Plan your installation for that, and you should be able to make any printer safe for your required use.</p>

<p>If, however, you plan on setting up a printer farm with many printers, and plan to have yourself or others spend significant time operating them, I suggest you work with a health and safety professional and have them identify possible hazards and plan mitigation.</p>
",,,,
12,2,2016-01-12T19:13:00.710,23,,"<p>There is very little information about safety available, as home 3D printers are relatively new. However, plastics such as ABS have a long history in making plastic products, and a study found that at traditional manufacturing methods (such as injection molding and hot wire cutting) <a href=""http://annhyg.oxfordjournals.org/content/57/3/399"">do not release dangerous levels of carcinogens and/or respiratory sensitizers in to the air</a>.</p>

<p>Of course, 3D printers are not among the processes covered in the study. In home 3D printing circles, <a href=""http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1352231013005086"">this study</a> that looks at ultrafine particle (UFP) emissions, is often cited. It finds that printing ABS releases relatively high levels of UFP's and PLA releases significantly fewer (but still quite a large amount). However, it is unclear whether/how dangerous these UFP's are in the amounts emitted.</p>

<p>It is often suggested that PLA, partly because of the reduced UFP emissions is safer to print than ABS, partly because of its ""natural"" origins as it can be derived from materials such as cornstarch. I would caution against this line of reasoning since ""natural"" materials can still be poisonous (snake venom is natural, after all) and the cornstarch is heavily processed so it hardly resembles its original form. The lower UFP emissions may suggest it is safer, but the study is only quantitative, not qualitative.</p>

<p>That said, PLA does probably pose less of a risk (despite my earlier argumentation against ""natural"" materials, PLA does play quite nicely with the human body), but I contend the risk with ABS is not too large anyways, given that it has been safely used in factories for decades.</p>

<p><a href=""http://fire.nist.gov/bfrlpubs/fire86/art017.html"">Another study</a> is often miscited, supposedly saying that 3D printing ABS releases hydrogen cyanide. The study only looks at the thermal decomposition of ABS, which happens at significantly higher temperatures than are reached during printing (but a significantly malfunctioning printer might cause toxic gasses to be released, but I contend that at that point you should worry about your printer being on fire, rather than temporary exposure to some toxins).</p>

<p>There are no printers out there that are fundamentally safer than others. However, some printers have an enclosure (containing the fumes) and some even have a carbon filter and a fan for fume extraction. If you would like to err on the side of caution, this might be a good choice (but again, it is not clear if a carbon filter is totally effective).</p>

<p>Finally, as printers are generally quite noisy it tends to be preferrable to keep your printer in a separate room from where you usually work. In this case, fume exposure (during the few minutes that you go to check on your print) is minimal, and the potential advantages of a ""safer"" printers or using ""safer"" materials diminish.</p>

<p>Incidental exposure as a hobbyist is probably not a big deal; workers in factories are exposed to the fumes of melted plastic their entire lives and they don't seem to be dropping dead. On the other hand, if you are going to be printing structurally then it is probably preferable to move your printer to a separate room, if not because of health and safety because of the noise.</p>

15,2,2016-01-12T19:25:07.817,5,,"<p>Apart from the inherent process itself and direct health hazards from that, many 3D printers also require some complementary technology to work.</p>

<p>There are some special alloys, such as gold/silicon and various titanium-based ones, that become ""bulk metal glasses"" if cooled extremely quickly (for example, by sputtering onto a spinning cold surface).

<p>PLA has a reputation for being ""biodegradable"" and therefore it is often discouraged to use PLA outside and/or in contact with water. However, PLA only biodegrades under very specific conditions which it won't generally be exposed to so it can be used (though, as a harder and less flexible material it is more likely to be damaged by hail).</p>

If you are over temperature you may damage the filament and it could look good, but not melt correctly when used.  If you reel it too fast you may thin it out more than the intended diameter, or too slow and you may thicken it.

<p>When the raft/support is done with lines, putting pressure on the lines in the opposite direction should cause them to break off.  As you break some of the outer ones, the support can be pulled down which will continuously rip the support off.  There may be a few pieces that remain.  These can be removed with wood chisels. Sliding the pointed end between the support and the print will cut into the plastic which removes the support.  <em>Note: always push the chisel away from you as it may slip.

<p>Summary</p>

<ul>
<li>ABS: Stronger, machinable, more flexible, and more temperature
resistant than PLA. Typically printed on a heated bed. Warping is a common problem when printing ABS.</li>
<li>PLA: Wider range of filaments available, easier and in some cases faster to print. Not as strong as ABS and the fact that its biodegradable could be seen as both a benefit and a drawback.</li>
</ul>

<p>Material Properties:</p>

<ul>
<li>ABS: Strong plastic with mild flexibility. Naturally beige in color. Can be filled and sanded. Higher temperature. Easy to recycle.</li>
<li>PLA: Not as strong as ABS but more rigid. Naturally transparent. More difficult to fill and sand. Can sag in hot temperatures. Sourced from organic matter so it can be broken down in commercial compost facilities.</li>
</ul>

<p>Part Accuracy:</p>

<ul>
<li>ABS: Part warping is a significant issue. Sharp corners will often be rounded.</li>
<li>PLA: Less heat required contributes to less warping. Becomes more liquid at common extruder temperatures so finer details can be printed.</li>
</ul>

<p>Safety and Handling:</p>

<ul>
<li>ABS: Strong burning/melting plastic smell is present when printing ABS. Health concerns have been raised regarding airborne ultrafine particles generated while printing with ABS (<a href=""https://dx.doi.org/10.1016%2Fj.atmosenv.2013.06.050"">ref</a>). ABS will absorb moisture causing popping when the moisture enters the hot end. This leads to discontinuities in the print job.</li>
<li>PLA: Doesn't smell as strongly when printing due to its organic nature. Moisture can also be absorbed into PLA and can irreversibly damage it.</li>

While not as dense as solid metal, it's about 3 times as dense as regular plastic and when polished the metal shows through.  Print at 100% infill to make it heavier. Bronzefill is about 3.9g/cm³, about 80% metal by weight, maybe 30-40% by volume.  I wouldn't say the polished result feel like solid metal, but it feels even less like plastic.</p>

<p>This is just one suggestion of many solutions. Here are some other variables I could think of off-hand:</p>

<ul>
<li>Type of build plate tape (ie masking, painters, kapton, etc.)</li>
<li>Type of material. I've noticed that PLA is very stubborn if you let the part completely cool after printing and that it's much easier to remove the part from the build plate/raft right after it's complete.</li>
<li>Type of build plate. Are you applying too much heat (if you have a heated bp) for the material such as PLA?</li>
<li>Try lowering your layer height. This will ensure that each strand does not have too much surface area and therefore less chance that it will create a vacuum affect with the build plate. This can, however, result in a worse surface finish.</li>

<ul>
<li><strong><a href=""http://sinkhacks.com/building-acetone-vapor-bath-smoothing-3d-printed-parts/"" rel=""nofollow"">Make sure the area is well-ventilated.</a></strong> Acetone is flammable. A buildup of acetone gas could quickly get concentrated, meaning that a single spark could lead to disaster. Using a fan is good; angle it towards an open window. This is also to prevent exposure to acetone because of its toxicity.</li>
<li><strong><a href=""http://www.sciencelab.com/msds.php?msdsId=9927062"" rel=""nofollow"">Be prepared to fight a fire.</a></strong> Should vapor ignite, you may need to fight the fire. If it is large enough, then you should clearly evacuate the area. If it appears to be small, use dry chemical powder to snuff out the fire. Alcohol foam, water spray, and/or fog may be used on slightly larger fires. Acetone is not likely to cause a large inferno to rip through the building. But there's always the chance of a small fire. Be careful.</li>
<li><strong><a href=""https://rivercitylabs.org/acetone-smoothing-chamber-3d-printing/"" rel=""nofollow"">Create a vapor chamber.</a></strong> This is another way to stop a potential fire from spreading. It can also reduce contamination.</li>
<li><strong>Wear gloves.</strong> This can minimize any potential transfer toxic effects. However, skin exposure is unlikely to cause major issues.</li>
</ul>

<p>Acetone is toxic, as I mentioned before, but it is not highly toxic. Exposure via <a href=""http://ccohs.ca/oshanswers/chemicals/chem_profiles/acetone.html"" rel=""nofollow"">the eyes and nose/mouth</a> is the main risk. Skin effects may occur (e.g. mild irritation), but they are minor and generally arise only after long-term exposure (hence the recommendation of gloves in some cases).</p>

<p>Acetone exposure is only a serious problem when a person is repeatedly exposed to levels <a href=""http://www.cdc.gov/niosh/idlh/67641.html"" rel=""nofollow"">greater than 1,000 ppm</a> (severe effects only arise at much higher levels). It seems unlikely, given a proper ventilation system, that this will be an issue</p>

<p>In addition to all this, basic safety precautions such as wearing a ventilator mask and goggles should definitely be taken. When working with any such chemicals with the potential for bodily harm, these should absolutely be used.</p>

<p>PLA - The brand of PLA makes a big difference, some can be printed very clear, some can't.  Most of the transparent PLAs I've used print much more clear at around 240°C.</p>

<p>ABS - I've seen some pretty impressive clear parts printed as a single layer shell in ABS and then vapor smoothed. I tend to find ABS more translucent and less transparent though.</p>

<p>PETG - Again the specific PETG you use matters, but I haven't seen nearly as much variation as with PLA.  I'm not sure how much temperature matters, but if it's too hot you get bubbles which will decrease clarity.</p>

<p>Thin Wall Prints - I don't have much experience here, but the Smooth On XTC-3D or vapor smoothing seem to be effective.</p>

<p>Solid Prints
If I want transparency, I usually print it at 100% infill (should be a real 100%, too much overextrusion or underextrusion will decrease transparency).  Printing slower and with less cooling sometimes helps.  It's easier to get the infill solid with a direct drive extruder, I couldn't get decent results with a long bowden tube (a short bowden tube works fine).</p>

<p>Here's a page where I tested 10 transparent filaments, the printed samples are 2mm thick, 100% infill - <a href=""http://thrinter.com/10-transparent-filaments"">http://thrinter.com/10-transparent-filaments</a>.  Those samples are all overextruded a bit, you can get better results if you dial in the extrusion precisely, but that's hard to get right, and the optimal settings may change slightly depending on the part geometry.  Larger nozzles and thicker layers may help to, but I haven't experimented much with that as there are significant downsides to that approach.</p>

<p>For big prints I like big <a href=""http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/B001449TPS"">generic sandpaper sheets</a> from the hardware store. Starting with the highest grit and moving down.

<p>I've also had some success sanding with my <a href=""http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/B00005LEXX"">Dremel</a> when it comes to annoying stuck on supports or other imperfections. Having some horsepower behind your sanding can be a nice break. I've also seen the <a href=""http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/B000HWRU9U"">wire brush attachments</a> used for finishing Bronze and Copper-fill prints. Just keep an eye on your speed or you'll sand a hole in your print.</p>

<p>Lastly (and one I haven't tried) are <a href=""http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/B0039ZCQAK"">these sanding sticks</a> They were recommended by a friend and look like they would be pretty easy to use/swap out used sandpaper. </p>

A slurry of old scrap ABS and acetone also works well, though I find that it will evaporate even if left in a closed mason jar over time. The small nozzle applicator and the fact it doesn't seem to evaporate makes super glue the better choice for me. </p>

<p>The gel super glue works ""OK"" for PLA but I've had parts fail after taking a small tumble. I just started using this <a href=""http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/B003HNFLMY"" rel=""noreferrer"">acrylic cement</a> for PLA.

<p>Here are some tips to help uphold strength requirements:</p>

<ul>
<li>Identify where your stresses are and avoid allowing the natural ""grain"" of the print (i.e. each layer) to coincide with the stresses of the part. For example, I just printed a part with hinges today. I set my part up to ensure that the circular profile of the hinge on each layer, instead of having the machine ""bridge"" the circular profile.</li>
<li>Make your part more solid by increasing the infill. Note that somewhere around 35% won't really provide much more strength than say 50% with a standard infill pattern (i.e. hexagonal, diamond, catfill). However, I would imagine that if a spherical infill pattern was ever designed, that would be the strongest.</li>
<li>An easy way to beef up small areas of a part is to increase your shell variable (how many profile layers for each layer). Again, referencing my hinge design, I made sure that my hinges were completely printed using shell instead of shell/infill.</li>
<li>Don't be afraid to do some post-processing such as adding epoxy/epoxies in high-stress areas.</li>
</ul>

<p>If it's not an expensive part to print, I would suggest playing with some of these ideas yourself and conduct controlled tests to see what setups work best for your application(s).</p>

<p>Essentially, you can use the Replicator G slicing program and there is a setting for ""ABP"" or Automatic Build Plate.

<p>Forgot to mention that if you choose to create your own ""Boxing Glove"" or conveyor belt, some software such as Octo-Pi and Repetier-Host allow plugins.

148,2,2016-01-13T06:21:21.800,6,,"<p>An option that might be feasible for some situations (depending on your setup) is <strong>Sequential Printing</strong> - a feature provided by some slicing software, for instance <a href=""http://manual.slic3r.org/advanced/sequential-printing"">Slic3r</a>.</p>

<p>In short, this allows you to print multiple objects <strong>one at a time</strong> rather than simultaneously. This has some obvious benefits, but also some downsides:</p>

<p><strong>Benefits:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Each object is finished individually, and you will therefore not have multiple half-finished prints <em>when</em> something goes wrong. </li>
<li>No particular printer or bed swapping mechanic is needed.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Downsides:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>With most consumer printer, print area is somewhat limited, and sequential printing requires you to place objects so that the hot end can move freely between the finished objects, potentially restricting the effective usage of your print volume.</li>
<li>By printing objects one at a time, you limit the natural print cooling that happens when printing multiple objects at the same time. In particular for smaller prints, you might not want to print sequentially unless your print cooling solution is up for it.</li>
<li>Requires some setup</li>
</ul>

<p>You specifically mention that you would like the finished prints to be moved outside the print area. In it self, sequential printing does not do this for you; however, if you fit your printer with a large, motorized print bed, you might achieve the same effect without moving into unfamiliar technology!</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Polyamide 3D printing is achieved through SLS 3D printing. It offers
  strong and flexible prints. The upside of this material is that the
  printing technology requires minimum preparation of the 3D file before
  printing. There is no need for support. And it also offers the
  possibility to create intricate shapes and moving part in just one go.

<blockquote>
  <p>Carbon fiber consists of 90% carbon atoms, each fiber is 10 times
  thinner than a human hair. Carbon is especially prized for its lack of
  combustibility and infusability but also by its incredible strength
  (stronger than steel) and ability to create flexible structure, light
  weight and corrosion resistance. Its melting temperature is 1500, this

<p>Although microstepping increases theoretical resolution it does not necessarily increase accuracy. The reason is that microstepping significantly limits the incremental torque of the motor. This means that you may ask for a step but not get one because the torque of the step won't be enough to actually turn the shaft.</p>

<p>As an example: a motor running in full steps will have 100% of its rated holding torque. Moving to 16 microsteps/full steps drops this to ~10%, 128 drops it to ~1%.</p>

<p>The practical effect of this is that in high torque situations (such as printing at fast speeds) the motor may end up skipping some of the steps. In this way the increase in resolution can actually lead to a decrease in accuracy (smaller steps but they may not actually be taken).</p>

<p>A relevant calculation to do would be to work out what the different number of microsteps to full steps works out to in terms of horizontal, vertical, or whatever movement the motor drives. You can do this by measuring how far the stepper moves said surface in one revolution provided you know the number of steps it takes per revolution.</p>

<p><strong>Example:</strong> </p>

<p>With no microstepping: 1 turn/inch * 200 steps/turn = 200 steps/inch or .005 inch/step (127 micron resolution)</p>

<p>With 16x microstepping: 16 * 200 steps/inch or .0003 inch / step (8 micron resolution)</p>

<p>In this example 128x microstepping would be absolutely foolish. Every situation is different and you should use this information to make a decision based on your setup. Many manufacturers have recommendations on how far their motors can be microstepped.</p>

Binding within the filament feeder and feeder tubes can also be a cause. Bubbles in the filament, or sometimes a mismatch between the filament ideal temperature and the head temperature could create results like this, but it probably wouldn't vary so much between the layers.</p>

<p>Next I'd look at the print head.  If it has blockages, or poor temperature control this could result.</p>

<p>Lastly, I'd check the mechanisms - disconnect the motors and see if all the carriages slide smoothly without any binding, particularly the Z axis.  It doesn't look like you're missing steps, but binding here may result in greater backlash, which could result in similar ridges. Make sure any belts and gears are tight.</p>
